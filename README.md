This is the NVIDIA CUDA C++ implementation of the algorithm Practical Recursive Projected Compressed Sensing (PracReProCS) proposed by Chenlu Qiu and Namrata Vaswani.

It uses NVIDIA CUDA toolkit including CUBLAS, CUSOLVER and Thrust. Also, it uses CImg image processing library for visualization purpose.

CImg and CSVParser library should be included (the header files) to use with this program.

ATTENTION!!!!!

FULL OF BUGS, USE CAREFULLY!!!!!
